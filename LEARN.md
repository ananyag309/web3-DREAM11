# Learn

Welcome to the learning guide for our open-source project! This document provides an overview of the technologies used in this repository and includes resources to help you get started with each. Whether you're new to the stack or want to deepen your understanding, this guide will help you on your journey.

## Tech Stack Overview

Our project uses the following technologies:

- **Solidity**: A programming language used for writing smart contracts on Ethereum and other blockchain platforms.
- **JavaScript**: A versatile scripting language primarily used for building interactive web applications.
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications (SPAs).
- **Node.js**: A runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server-side.
- **Ethereum**: A decentralized blockchain platform that supports smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps).
- **Web3.js**: A JavaScript library for interacting with Ethereum nodes and smart contracts.
- **Truffle/Hardhat**: Tools for smart contract development, testing, and deployment.
